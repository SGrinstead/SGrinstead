## About Me
I started out working in outdoor education, and while I greatly enjoyed my work and learned valuable skills like teamwork and on-the-fly problem solving, I began to feel like I didn't see a future for myself in that career. So, after giving it a lot of thought, I decided that I needed to make a change.

I spent a lot of time looking for an excellent program to learn software development. It was something I had some previous experience with and knew that it was a field that I enjoyed and picked up on very quickly, and I felt that I would have room for growth that I didn't feel I had in outdoor education.

Over the past year, I have been honing my coding skills and learning as much as I can To get my career in software development started. If you think I would be a valuable addition to your development team, you can connect with me at seth.grinstead3299@gmail.com
